# global-solution-1
Front end beginner project for conclusion of the first semester in my college course, in partership with Stellantis, themed "smart mobility". 

Our group's idea for this project was a platform which, through a points and rewards system, encourages people to use sustainable means of transportation.

The tools used for this project were HTML and CSS.
